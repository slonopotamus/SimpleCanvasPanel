= Simple Canvas Panel

Simple Canvas Panel is an Unreal Engine UMG widget for `SCanvas`, a simpler and faster alternative to builtin `CanvasPanel` that internally uses `SConstraintCanvas`.
The key advantage of `SCanvas` over `SConstraintCanvas` is that the former doesn't need to recalculate layout when child size changes.

Supports Unreal Engine 4.27 and newer.
